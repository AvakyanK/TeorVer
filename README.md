# TeorVero

This gem allows you to use the basic formulas of probability theory from the section on discrete random variables.

## Installationbundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add TeorVero

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install TeorVero

## Usage

You can calculate the expected value with
'''ruby
matojid(x, y=:None)
'''.
x and y can be interchanged
Here and below, x can take the following data types:
1. x = c; (c = const) (x = c; y = c => Error)
2. x = [1, 2, 3] y = [0.1, 0,2, 0.7] These arrays contain the values of random variables and their probabilities
3. x = [[1, 2, 3], [0.1, 0,2, 0.7]] The array accepts both random values and their probabilities. Order doesn't matter
4. x = [[x1, p1], [x2, p2], [x3, p3]] x takes a random value, p takes its probability
5. x = {"x1" => 1, "x2" => 2, "x3" => 3} y = {"p1" => 0.1, "p2" => 0.2, "p3" => 0.7 }
<<<<<<< HEAD
6. x = {x1:p1, x2:p2, x3:p3} The key is a random value, the value is its probability. Order is important
=======
6. x = {x1=>p1, x2=>p2, x3=>p3} The key is a random value, the value is its probability. Order is important

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
